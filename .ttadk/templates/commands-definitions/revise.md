description: update existing feature documents (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md) on the current feature branch without creating a new branch.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```
You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

If the given `$ARGUMENTS` contains a link, you need to read the content of the link (use lark-docs mcp if it's a lark doc) and replace the link with content.

## Phase

- ### **Phase 1: Context & Environment Setup**

  **Objective:** Gather all necessary context and configure the environment.

  1.  **Set Language:**
      - Read `.ttadk/config.yaml` to determine `preferred_language`.
      - Default to 'en' if the file or key is missing.
      - **Crucially, all subsequent outputs MUST be in this language.**
  2.  **Load Core Instructions:**
      - Read `.ttadk/memory/constitution.md`.
      - These are your guiding principles. Adhere to them strictly.
  3.  **Analyze User Request (`$ARGUMENTS`):**
      - If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a URL (e.g., a Lark document), fetch its full content and use that as the primary input.
      - Carefully parse the final text to understand the update requirements.
  4.  **Gather Project Context:**
      - Execute `node .ttadk/scripts/get-stack-context.js json` to load all available tech stack references.
      - **IMPORTANT**: You can access references from ANY stack as needed (backend-gdp, backend-kitex, backend-hertz, frontend-nodejs, frontend-platform, frontend-lynx, common). All stacks are available.
      - Refer to the description in the references section to quickly identify which tech stack knowledge you need.

  ### **Phase 2: Analysis & Validation**

  **Objective:** Validate we're on a valid feature branch and understand current state.

  1.  **Get Current Branch & Locate Documents:**
      - Run `node .ttadk/scripts/check-prerequisites.js --json --paths-only` to get FEATURE_DIR from the current branch.

  2.  **Locate Existing Documents:**
      - The feature documents should be in `specs/{branch-name}/` directory:
        - `spec.md`: Feature specification
        - `plan.md`: Implementation plan
        - `tasks.md`: Task breakdown
        - `technical-design.md`: Technical Design Document (optional, from `/adk:erd`)
      - If any of the core files (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md) don't exist, **STOP** and inform the user:
        - "Cannot find feature documents in specs/{branch-name}/"
        - "Please use /adkl:proposal first to create the initial documents"
      - Check if `technical-design.md` exists and note this for later updates

  3.  **Read Current State:**
      - Read all existing documents to understand:
        - Current feature requirements (spec.md)
        - Current technical approach (plan.md)
        - Current task breakdown (tasks.md)
        - Current technical design (technical-design.md, if exists)
      - **CRITICAL**: Read the content after spec.md's `**Input**:` field - this is the user's original input and must be understood carefully. If it references a local markdown file, read that file too.
      - Use tools like `rg` and `ls` to explore related code changes that may have been implemented.

  4.  **Clarification (Interactive Step):**
      - **If the update request is ambiguous, incomplete, or conflicts with existing documents or code:**
          - Formulate specific, targeted questions for the user.
          - **Do not proceed until you receive clarification.** This prevents rework and ensures alignment.

  ### **Phase 3: Document Update**

  **Objective:** Update core design documents, then synchronize technical documentation.

  1.  **Update Feature Specification (`spec.md`):**
      - Read existing `spec.md` to understand current requirements.
      - Integrate the new requirements from `$ARGUMENTS` with existing content.
      - Update sections as needed while maintaining the original template structure.
      - Ensure the updated spec clearly reflects both existing and new requirements.
      - **Important:** Preserve any sections that are still relevant; only update what needs to change.

  2.  **Update Implementation Plan (`plan.md`):**
      - Read existing `plan.md` to understand current technical approach.
      - Adjust the technical solution to accommodate changes from the updated `spec.md`.
      - Update affected sections: architecture changes, file modifications, API changes, etc.
      - Ensure consistency with the updated specification.
      - **Important:** Consider backward compatibility and migration paths if applicable.

  3.  **Update Task Breakdown (`tasks.md`):**
      - Read existing `tasks.md` to understand current task breakdown.
      - Update tasks to reflect changes from the updated `plan.md`.
      - Mark any obsolete tasks appropriately (e.g., strikethrough or remove if not started).
      - Add new tasks for new requirements.
      - Reorder tasks if the implementation sequence has changed.
      - **Important:** Maintain traceability to User Stories defined in the plan.

  4.  **Save all core document updates:**
      - Write updated `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md` to disk.
      - **This ensures ERD update in next step can reference the latest changes.**

  5.  **Update Technical Design Document (`technical-design.md`) - If Exists:**
      - **IMPORTANT: Only execute this step AFTER steps 1-4 are completed and saved.**
      - **Check if `technical-design.md` exists in the feature directory.**
      - **If technical-design.md exists:**
        - Read existing `technical-design.md` to understand current technical design (architecture, data model, interfaces, schemas).
        - Analyze changes based on:
          - **The just-updated `spec.md` requirements** (new entities, changed data requirements)
          - **The just-updated `plan.md` technical approach** (especially data-model.md if it was updated)
          - **User's original input from `$ARGUMENTS`** (any technical design feedback)
        - Update the technical design to reflect:
          - Architecture diagram changes
          - New entities or fields mentioned in updated requirements
          - Modified relationships due to architectural changes
          - Updated interface definitions (API/RPC)
          - Updated schema definitions (DB/MQ/Cache)
        - Regenerate Mermaid diagrams with updates.
        - Ensure all Mermaid diagrams follow correct syntax.
        - Save updated `technical-design.md`.
      - **If technical-design.md does not exist:** Skip this step (user can generate it later with `/adk:erd`).

  ### **Phase 4: Summary and Next Steps**

  **Objective:** Provide clear summary of changes and guidance for next steps.

  1.  **Summarize Changes:**
      - Provide a concise summary of what changed in each document:
        - spec.md: New/modified requirements
        - plan.md: Updated technical approach
        - tasks.md: New/modified/removed tasks
        - technical-design.md: Updated technical design (if exists)
      - Highlight any breaking changes or significant architectural shifts.

  2.  **Recommend Next Steps:**
      - Suggest immediate actions the developer should take (e.g., review specific sections, update code, run tests).
      - Note any potential impacts on existing implementation.

  ### **Guiding Principles (Guardrails)**

  - **Preservation First:** Only update what needs to change. Preserve existing content that remains valid.
  - **Consistency:** Ensure all three documents remain aligned with each other after updates.
  - **Traceability:** Maintain clear connections between spec requirements, plan implementation, and task breakdown.
  - **Clarity:** Make it obvious what changed and why.
  - **Respect Templates:** Preserve the section order and headings of all template files.
  - **URL Content Fetch**: Use lark-docs mcp to get a lark document content.
  - **No Branch Creation:** This command updates existing documents only; it does NOT create a new branch.
