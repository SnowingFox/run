# [PROJECT_NAME] Constitution
<!-- Example: Spec Constitution, TaskFlow Constitution, etc. -->

## Core Principles

### [PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]
<!-- Example: I. Library-First -->
[PRINCIPLE_1_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Every feature starts as a standalone library; Libraries must be self-contained, independently testable, documented; Clear purpose required - no organizational-only libraries -->

### [PRINCIPLE_2_NAME]
<!-- Example: II. CLI Interface -->
[PRINCIPLE_2_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Every library exposes functionality via CLI; Text in/out protocol: stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr; Support JSON + human-readable formats -->

### [PRINCIPLE_3_NAME]
<!-- Example: III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE) -->
[PRINCIPLE_3_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced -->

### [PRINCIPLE_4_NAME]
<!-- Example: IV. Integration Testing -->
[PRINCIPLE_4_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas -->

### [PRINCIPLE_5_NAME]
<!-- Example: V. Observability, VI. Versioning & Breaking Changes, VII. Simplicity -->
[PRINCIPLE_5_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Text I/O ensures debuggability; Structured logging required; Or: MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format; Or: Start simple, YAGNI principles -->

## [SECTION_2_NAME]
<!-- Example: Additional Constraints, Security Requirements, Performance Standards, etc. -->

[SECTION_2_CONTENT]
<!-- Example: Technology stack requirements, compliance standards, deployment policies, etc. -->

## [SECTION_3_NAME]
<!-- Example: Development Workflow, Review Process, Quality Gates, etc. -->

[SECTION_3_CONTENT]
<!-- Example: Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process, etc. -->

## Governance
<!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

[GOVERNANCE_RULES]
<!-- Example: All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE] for runtime development guidance -->

## Fixed Rules
<!-- NOTE: This section is NOT a template - preserve as-is during constitution updates. However, the language of these rules should match the document's overall language (translate if needed while keeping the same meaning). -->

When user requests to commit code (e.g., "help me commit", "commit changes", "please commit"), automatically execute `/adk:commit` to commit changes.

When implementing features or writing code, prioritize referencing existing codebase patterns, coding styles, and architectural designs to maintain consistency.

When encountering unfamiliar technical concepts or internal knowledge, use `tiksearch` MCP tool to search for relevant documentation and best practices.
